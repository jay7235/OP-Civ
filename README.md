# Unciv-New-Civ

A new nation Mod for Unciv that adds two new Civilizations.
I left their default Civ in the mod and created my own.
The Civs are overpowered, and the one I crafted has almost all the unique buildings from vanilla and God & Kings.

I want to thank the creators of Unciv for their easy walkthrough on how to build your own Unciv mod.
