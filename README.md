# Unciv-New-Civ

A new nation Mod for Unciv, it adds one new Civilization.
The Civ is overpowered and has almost all the unique buildings from vanilla and God & Kings.

I want to thank the creators of Unciv for their easy walkthrough on how to build your own Unciv mod.
For information on how to build and use mods, please refer to [the setup instructions](https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Modders/Making-a-new-Civilization/)
